This project was essentially done to see the endless possibilities with Python. Visual Computing wasnâ€™t something I had done before but the idea seemed tempting and here we are. 

The PoseModule file has all the functions that are being called into the Kettlebell Swings Counter file. 

On running the PoseModule it just shows all the landmarks that it is able to identify (along with other functions that are not called).

Kettlebell Swings Counter goes a step further and based on the hard-coded points, it would find the angle between the points and based on that angle change, count the number of repetitions that have occurred.
